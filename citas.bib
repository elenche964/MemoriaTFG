abstract = {Purpose: Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease require support across the full disease trajectory. The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework of caregiving phases across the Alzheimer's disease and caregiving trajectories and the corresponding caregiver support needs. Materials and methods: Constructivist grounded theory informed data collection and analysis. 40 spousal (n = 20) and adult children (n = 20) caregivers were interviewed. Recruitment was completed when theoretical saturation was achieved. Member-checking interviews occurred with 10 participants. Results: Participants described five phases of caregiving related to their responsibilities to support people with Alzheimer's disease including monitoring initial symptoms, navigating their diagnosis, assisting with instrumental activities of daily living, assisting with basic activities of daily living, and preparing for the future. Support (i.e., informational, emotional, instrumental, and appraisal) needs were often specific to the phase of care. For example, during the initial symptoms phase, caregivers reported needing information to assist them to distinguish normal aging from cognitive impairment. In contrast, during the preparing for the future phase, caregivers emphasized support for accessing institutional long term-care placement. Conclusions: Findings highlight caregiver-identified phases of caregiving and corresponding support needs across the Alzheimer's disease trajectory. Findings can inform the development, evaluation and implementation of programs and services to meet caregivers' changing needs across the disease trajectory.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Caregivers for individuals with Alzheimer's disease can experience distinct caregiving phases across the disease trajectory with corresponding support needs. Rehabilitation clinicians can use these findings to help caregivers navigate available supports at appropriate times to ensure that their needs are addressed across the disease trajectory. Occupational therapists and other rehabilitation professionals can enable caregivers with timely education and support as they progress across the disease trajectory.},

@article{BarraganMartinez2019,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent cause of dementia, and is considered one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among elderly patients. A progressive and irreversible deterioration in cognitive functions (specially short-term memory loss) is caused by brain $\beta$-amyloid and $\tau$-protein deposits that increase gradually functional dependency. Among the causes of Alzheimer's disease, three genes and other genetic and environmental factors have been identified. Because aging is the main trigger cause, an increasing trend in its prevalence is expected in the future. Recently diagnostic criteria have been updated; complementary tests might help the diagnostic, which still remains fundamentally clinical. Definitive diagnosis still relies upon neuropathological findings, however genetic and in vivo amyloid imaging tests have improved significantly. In order to understand the disease and to develop preventive and therapeutic measures, the knowledge of the clinical manifestation, risk factors, genetics, neuropathology and neuroimaging is required.},

abstract = {This paper examines the issue of providing care to an increasing elderly population presenting a strong desire to continue living at home. A smart home system designed to operate via an Amazon Echo, the Alexa Eldercare Toolbox, was designed to address some of the everyday struggles faced in the home eldercare scenario. A specific focus was placed on addressing the needs of Alzheimer's patients, who struggle more than the rest of the population to tend to their own needs. Measures were also taken to assist the patients' caretakers, who are so often forgotten in this context. An examination of the problem, a description of the Alexa Eldercare Toolbox and how it was developed, a discussion of the implications of this potential solution, and a listing of next steps are provided in this text.},
